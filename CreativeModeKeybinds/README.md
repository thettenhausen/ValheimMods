Since I do not play with the typical WASD key bindings (I started using my own key bindings at a time when the arrow keys were the default keys for movement) I often have problems when keys are hardcoded in games. In Valheim, the keys in creative mode are hardcoded, e.g. to toggle flying (Z) and whether to use resources while building (B).
This plugin simply hardcodes them to other values (Flying is now 7 and the no resource mode is now 8 on the numpad).
TODO: make the keys configurable via Configuration Manager.
